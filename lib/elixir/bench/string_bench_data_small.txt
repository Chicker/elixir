                    In the Name of Allah,
            the Compassionating, the Compassionate!

PRAISE BE TO ALLAH - THE BENEFICENT KING - THE CREATOR
OF THE UNIVERSE - LORD OF THE THREE WORLDS - WHO SET UP
THE FIRMAMENT WITHOUT PILLARS IN ITS STEAD - AND WHO
STRETCHED OUT THE EARTH EVEN AS A BED - AND GRACE, AND
PRAYER-BLESSING BE UPON OUR LORD MOHAMMED - LORD OF
APOSTOLIC MEN - AND UPON HIS FAMILY AND COMPANION TRAIN
- PRAYER AND BLESSINGS ENDURING AND GRACE WHICH UNTO THE
DAY OF DOOM SHALL REMAIN - AMEN! - O THOU OF THE THREE
WORLDS SOVEREIGN!

  AND AFTERWARD. Verily the works and words of those gone before us
have become instances and examples to men of our modern day, that folk
may view what admonishing chances befell other folk and may
therefrom take warning; and that they may peruse the annals of antique
peoples and all that hath betided them, and be thereby ruled and
restrained. Praise, therefore, be to Him who hath made the histories
of the past an admonition unto the present! Now of such instances
are the tales called "A Thousand Nights and a Night," together with

of chance or change affect His sway, Whom one case diverteth not
from other case and Who is sole in the attributes of perfect grace.
And prayer and peace he upon the Lord's Pontiff and Chosen One among
His creatures, our lord MOHAMMED, the Prince of mankind, through
whom we supplicate Him for a goodly and a godly

[Nicolт Machiavelli al Magnifico Lorenzo de' Medici]

Sogliono, el piщ delle volte, coloro che desiderano acquistare grazia appresso uno Principe, farseli incontro con quelle cose che infra le loro abbino piщ care, o delle quali vegghino lui piщ delettarsi; donde si vede molte volte essere loro presentati cavalli, arme, drappi d'oro, prete preziose e simili ornamenti, degni della grandezza di quelli. Desiderando io adunque, offerirmi,
